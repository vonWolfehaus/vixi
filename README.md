# vixi (von pixi)

Small, fast image drawing library for the HTML5 canvas element.

I took most of the code from the [PIXI library](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js), which has a ton more features like a WebGL renderer, filters, input, and... everything else. I stripped out those features for more control and to let weaker mobile devices handle it easier.

I made vixi because I needed a tiny, fast canvas library for the multitude of experiments and prototypes I build that still had support for great stuff like containers, a proper stage, and all the fun of matrix transforms (scale, skew, rotation).
