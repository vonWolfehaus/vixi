# von2d

Small, fast image drawing library for the HTML5 canvas element.

I borrowed most of the code from the badass [PIXI library](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js), which has a ton more features like a WebGL renderer, filters, input, and... everything else. I made it more garbage collection friendly though so it's great for mobile devices.

I made von2d because I needed a tiny, fast canvas library for the multitude of experiments and prototypes I build that still had support for great stuff like containers, a proper stage, and all the fun of matrix transforms (scale, skew, rotation).

### ToDo

I have to put blend modes back in. Then I'm calling it good.
